- [x] Wire SOPS defaults into encrypt/decrypt CLI (backend selection, config paths).
- [x] Document SOPS usage in encryption guides and CLI references; clarify dotenvx-only workflows.
- [x] Add tests for SOPS backend config and CLI defaults.
- [x] Confirm SOPS install behavior and decide on an installation strategy.
